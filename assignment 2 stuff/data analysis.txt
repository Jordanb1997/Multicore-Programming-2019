the results of the tests show that having both triangles and spheres simdified provides great performance
benefits to some cases and little benefits for others. the variance of performance for different images is
due to the number of shapes that must be calculated. the two bunny images see the greatest performance increase 
with the bunny500 image being reduced from 4229ms when only sphere SIMD is used to 2016ms when triangles are
SIMD. Conversley the 5000spheres image performs better because of the sphere SIMD since there is more spheres
than triangles.

the allmaterials image and the cornell 500x300 image see very little performance benefit. there is a very small amount of 
spheres and triangles in the cornell image leading to no meaningful benefits from SIMD.
